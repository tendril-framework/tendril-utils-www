httpx based www backend (:mod:`tendril.utils.www.hx`)
=====================================================

TODO Some introduction

This is added primarily for async support and interacting with internal APIs..

Features such as caching and proxy support are not presently implemented, but
should be. Note that both proxying and caching for the present intended
applications need exclusion/bypass mechanisms.

New code should preferentially use this backend when possible, and older code
using the other backend can be gradually moved here.
